# week-4-game
There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal you will 		add a specific amount of points to your total score. <br>
				You win the game by matching your total score to the random number, you lose the game if your total score goes above the random number. <br>
				The value of each crystal is hidden until clicked.
				Each new game, the crystals will have a new value.
        
       - aesthetically this looks much better than the example picture.
          - If I wanted to change the colors I would have asigned a div id to the div and then manipulated its properties in my style.css file by 
          .example{background: Blue;
          
          }
